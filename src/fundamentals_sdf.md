Simulation Description Format (SDF) {#fundamentals__sdf}
======================

Gazebo uses XML to store world and model descriptions. A world file contains a description of the world, and a model file contains a description of a physical entity in the world.

Older versions of SDF are automatically translated to the version of SDF used by Gazebo.

**SDF Version formats:**

 Version 1.0: http://gazebosim.org/sdf/sdf\_1\_0.html

 Verstion 1.2: http://gazebosim.org/sdf/sdf\_1\_2.html
