Player {#started__interfaces__player}
===============

Gazebo can be used with [Player](http://playerstage.sf.net), which provides
libraries and tools useful for controlling robots, whether simulated or
physical.  Gazebo is connected to Player via a plugin, `gazebo_player`,
that is provided with Gazebo.  This plugin implements the more common
Player interfaces (contributions are most welcome to extend the plugin).
When the plugin is loaded, Gazebo appears just like a normal Player server
and can be controlled with standard Player clients.

To load the Player plugin....TODO
