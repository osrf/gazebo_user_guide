Graphical User Interface {#started_gui}
======================
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays the simulation. The GUI can, for some things, be used to interact with Gazebo without the command line. The 3D Window contains the world and model(s). The Scene Tree hierarchically presents all of the components that comprise the world and models. Users can adjust various component parameters by drilling down into each part.

### Moving in the 3D Window
To take advantage of Gazebo's camera and object manipulation controls, you'll need a three-button mouse with a scroll wheel. There are three modes for interacting with the 3D window. To switch between modes, select the appropriate arrow from the Toolbar.

**View Mode**

View Mode is used to move the camera in the scene to view the environment. When in this mode, you cannot move the models. Double-clicking on an object will switch you to Translate Mode where you can move objects.

**Translate Mode**

To switch to Translate Mode, double-click on a model, or select the four-headed arrow in the toolbar. To translate a model, click on the model you want to move and drag to the desired location. For more precise translation, hold down the x, y, or z keys while dragging to move only along those axes. The scroll wheel maintains the functionality found in View Mode.

**Rotate Mode**

Rotate Mode allows you to rotate about each axis. Similar to Translate Mode, the x, y, and z keys are used to rotate about those axes. The scroll wheel maintains the functionality found in View Mode.
