Graphical User Interface {#started_gui}
======================
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays the simulation and lets user interact with the world via four components.  The GUI consists of the World View, Tree, Toolbar and Clock. The World View contains the world and model(s). The Tree hierarchically presents all of the components that make up the world and models. The Toolbar contains various controls that allow the user to switch interaction modes and insert simple shapes and lights. The clock at the bottom lets users play, pause and step through the simulation.

## The World View
The World View displays the world and all of the models therein. It is here that users can add, manipulate, and remove models. Users can switch between the View, Translate and Rotate modes in the left side of the Toolbar to switch between interaction modes within the World View. In View Mode, users can navigate around the world by panning, orbiting and zooming. Translate Mode affords users the ability to translate an object, and Rotate Mode, well, it lets you rotate an object. 

<!-- When an object is selected in the World View (by left-clicking in View Mode, or left-pressing in Translate or Rotate Modes), it is outlined in white. -->  

### Navigating in the World View
To take advantage of Gazebo's camera and object manipulation controls, you'll need a three-button mouse with a scroll wheel. There are three modes for interacting with the 3D window. To switch between modes, select the appropriate arrow from the Toolbar.

## The Tree
The Tree lists the models in the world, and allows users to change a variety of parameters for most models. The Tree is also where users can add new models to the world. The Tree consists of the World and Insert tabs. 

![Tree Tabs](../../images/TreeTabs.png "Tree Tabs")

### World Tab
This tab is divided into Scene, Physics, Models, and Lights. Each section contains relevant parameters that can be altered by the user. These parameters appear in the bottom half of the Tree when an item is selected. 


Right-clicking on a model in the Models section gives you three options: Move to, Delete, Control Joints. The first moves the view to be directly in front of that model. The second option deletes the model, and the third provides information on joint control.


### Insert Tab
The Insert Tab displays all of the models available for use in Gazebo. The first directory is your directory of local models. The second directory is the Gazebo model database. Once a model has been inserted from here, it will appear in the first local directory as well.

To add a model to the world, left-click on the desired model in the Insert Tab, and move the cursor to the World View. The model should be attached to the cursor. Move it to the desired location and left-click again to release. You can use the Translate and Rotate modes to orient the model more precisely.  


## Toolbar
The Toolbar sits in the top left corner of the World View and provides tools with which to navigate and manipulate the world. 

![Toolbar](../../images/Toolbar.png "Toolbar")

The arrow icons are the **View, Translate and Rotate modes.** These interaction modes allow users to navigate within the world and manipulate models. For more detailed information on using these modes, see Navigating in the World View (above). 

The **Cube, Sphere and Cylinder icons** let users add these simple shapes to the world. 

The **Point Light, Spot Light and Directional Light icons** allow users to insert light into the world. 


## Clock
Users can start, pause and step through the simulation with the clock, located at the bottom of the World View. 

![Clock](../../images/Clock.png "Clock")

**Real Time Factor:** Displays how fast or slow the simulation is running in comparison to real time (which is 1).

**Sim Time:** Displays how long the simulation has been running, based on the Real Time Factor.

**Real Time:** Displays how long the simulation has been running, based on real time.




## Menu

The menu options are as follows:

File --> Save World As (Saves the current world to file)
File --> Quit (Bet you can't guess!)

Edit--> Reset Model Poses (Resets all models to their position when they were first inserted)
Edit--> Reset World (Resets model poses AND time)

<!--Mention Snap to Grid -->
