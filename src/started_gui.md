Graphical User Interface {#started_gui}
======================
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) displays the simulation. The GUI can, for some things, be used to interact with Gazebo without the command line. The 3D Window contains the world and model(s). The Scene Tree hierarchically presents all of the components that comprise the world and models. Users can adjust various component parameters by drilling down into each part.

To take advantage of Gazebo's camera and object manipulation controls, you'll need a three-button mouse with a scroll wheel. There are three modes for interacting with the 3D window. To switch between modes, select the appropriate arrow from the Toolbar.
