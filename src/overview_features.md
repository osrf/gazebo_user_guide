========

Gazebo is a feature rich application that is under constant development from
a large user community. The follow lists a few of the primary features offered by Gazebo.

**Dynamics Simulation**

 > Access multiple physics engines including ODE and Bullet.

 > Direct control over physic engine parameters including accuracy, performance, and dynamic properties for each simulated model.

**Advanced 3D Graphics**
 
 > Utlizing OGRE, Gazebo provides realistic rendering of environments. State-of-the-art GPU shaders generate correct lighting and shadows for improved realism.

**Sensors**

 > Generate sensor information from laser range finders, 2D cameras, Kinect style sensors, contact sensors, and RFID sensors.

**Robot Models**

 > Many robot are provided including PR2, Pioneer2 DX, iRobot Create, TurtleBot, generic robot arms and grippers.

**Environments**
 
 > Access to many objects from simple shapes to terrain.

**Programmatic Interfaces**

 > Support for ROS and Player.

 > API for custom interfaces.

**Plugins**

 > Develop custom plugins for robot model control, interacting with world components

 > Provides direct control to all aspects of the simulation engine including the phyics engine, graphics libraries, and sensor generation

**TCP/IP Communication**

 > Run Gazebo on remote servers

 > Interface to Gazebo through socket-based message passing using Google Protobufs.

**Powerful Graphical Interface**

 > A lightweight QT based graphical interface provides users with direct control over many simulation parameters.

 > View and navigate through a running simulation.

**Collada Import**

 > Import meshes from many sources using Gazebo's built in Collada reader.

**Active User Community**

 > Research institutes around the world utilize and contribute to Gazebo.

 > Community supported help through a mailing list, and wiki.

**Person simulation**

 > Replay human motion capture data in a running simulation.
