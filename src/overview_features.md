![Features](GazeboFeatures.png "Features")

<!-- Gazebo is a feature-rich application that is under constant development by
a large user community. The following list presents a few of the primary features offered by Gazebo.

**Dynamics Simulation**

 • Access to multiple physics engines including ODE and Bullet.

 • Direct control over physics engine parameters including accuracy, performance, and dynamic properties for each simulated model.

**Advanced 3D Graphics**
 
 • Utilizing OGRE, Gazebo provides realistic rendering of environments. State-of-the-art GPU shaders generate correct lighting and shadows for improved realism.

**Sensors**

 • Generate sensor information from laser range finders, 2D cameras, Kinect-style sensors, contact sensors, and RFID sensors.

**Robot Models**

 • Many robot models are provided including: PR2, Pioneer2 DX, iRobot Create, TurtleBot, and generic robot arms and grippers.

**Environments**
 
 • Access to many objects ranging from simple shapes to terrain.

**Programmatic Interfaces**

 • Support for ROS and Player.

 • API for custom interfaces.

**Plugins**

 • Users can develop custom plugins for robot model control and interacting with world components.

 • Plugins provide direct control over all aspects of the simulation engine including the physics engine, graphics libraries, and sensor generation.

**TCP/IP Communication**

 • Gazebo can be run on remote servers.

 • Users can interface to Gazebo through socket-based message passing using Google Protobufs.

**Powerful Graphical Interface**

 • A lightweight QT-based graphical interface provides users with direct control over many simulation parameters.

 • Users can view and navigate through a running simulation.

**Collada Import**

 • Import meshes from many sources using Gazebo's built in Collada reader.

**Active User Community**

 • Research institutes around the world use and contribute to Gazebo.

 • Access community-supported help through a mailing list and wiki.

**Person simulation**

 • Replay human motion capture data in a running simulation. -->
