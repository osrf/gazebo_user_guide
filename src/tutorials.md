Tutorials {#tutorials}
=========
These tutorials constitute a core set of tasks that we think Gazebo users should be able to accomplish. The tutorials are divided into two parts: Using Gazebo and Modifying Gazebo. The former group of tutorials will help users get up and running with Gazebo, while the latter tutorials instruct users on how to modify Gazebo in a way more specific to their needs. We recommend that users not try to modify Gazebo until they understand the concepts presented in the Using Gazebo tutorials.

There are more tutorials available on the [Gazebo Wiki](http://gazebosim.org/wiki/Tutorials). 

We appreciate tutorial contributions to the Wiki. If you have a useful plugin or concept to demonstrate, please consider creating and sharing a tutorial so that others can benefit as well!

Note: We recommend that users new to Gazebo follow these tutorials in the order presented.
