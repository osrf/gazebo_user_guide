Simulation Description Format (SDF) {#started__sdf}
======================
NEEDS A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT SDF IS. 

Gazebo uses XML to store World and Model descriptions. A World file contains a description of the World, and a Model file contains a description of a physical entity in the World.

Older versions of SDF are automatically translated to the version of SDF used by Gazebo.

**SDF Version formats:**

 Version 1.0: http://gazebosim.org/sdf/sdf\_1\_0.html

 Version 1.2: http://gazebosim.org/sdf/sdf\_1\_2.html
